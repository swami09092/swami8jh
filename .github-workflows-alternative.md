# Development Note

This project is configured for **Cloudflare Workers deployment** and does not use the traditional Node.js/Express development workflow.

## How to Work on This Project

### 1. Frontend Development
```bash
# The Vite dev server for frontend-only development
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Full Stack Testing
```bash
# Build the frontend first
npm run build

# Then test with Wrangler
wrangler dev
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
npm run build
wrangler deploy
```

## Why the Workflow Fails

The Replit workflow is configured for Express.js but this app now uses:
- **Cloudflare Workers** (not Express)
- **Hono framework** (not Express)
- **Wrangler CLI** (not tsx/node)

## Alternative: Use Wrangler for Development

Instead of `npm run dev`, use:
```bash
wrangler dev
```

This starts a local Cloudflare Workers environment that matches production exactly.
